						Scope of Work
					</h2>
					<div className='flex flex-col gap-4.5'>
						<p className='text-[#6b6b6b] text-lg md:text-xl font-normal leading-7'>
							We work with our clients on thousands of construction projects
							each year, from the up-front contract review or title search, lien
							or bond claim enforcement, contractual dispute resolution,
							collection of the project AR, and when necessary, commercial
							litigation enforcement. Much of our work is handled in-house at
							WFJ, with the assistance of our client’s credit professionals, and
							without the need for a lawsuit. We work with our clients in
							routine collection matters, settlement payment plans, state and
							federal court litigation, mediation, arbitration and other
							alternative dispute resolution processes.
						</p>
						<p className='text-[#6b6b6b]  text-lg md:text-xl font-normal leading-7'>
							With WFJ as the quarterback in the collections process, not only
							do we manage your legal or collection expense spend, but more
							importantly, we serve as the one-stop shopexpert our clients can
							turn to, no matter where the issue arises. Our expertise in
							commercial collections management saves our clients time and the
							hassle of handling of relationships with our local resources all
							around the US and internationally.
						</p>
						<p className='text-[#6b6b6b]  text-lg md:text-xl font-normal leading-7'>
							In addition to collection work, WFJ can assist clients on lien,
							bond, and UCC perfection and enforcement, general contract
							negotiation concerns, and bankruptcy matters, including preference
							defense. We help them resolve performance issues and settle
							disputes. Our legal and practical knowledge of the construction
							industry and project types benefits clients because many of our
							clients have the same or similar customer base, so we are often
							the first to learn of problem accounts or distressed projects.
